// Read the instructions for each of the warm up exercises carefully. This may
// seem repititious or pedandtic at first, however it's very important that you
// become comfortable with these fundamental concepts. Do not move on to
// iteration 1 until you are confident that you've completed all of iteration 0.


//------------------------- Variables -------------------------//

// Initialize two new variables, "name", and "age", and assign values to them with
// your own name and age.

// var name = "Your name";
// var ...
var name = "Collie";
var age = 24;

// Initialize a new variable "someThing", but leave it undefined
var someThing = undefined


// Initialize a new variable "isHuman", and assign it to a boolean value of your
// choice
isHuman = true;


// Reassign (not initialize) your "age" variable from above. Use a built in math
// operator to make your age half of what it currently is.
age = age / 2;


// Create a variable named "greeting", and assign it to a greeting of your
// choice. Your chosen greeting must make use of your "name" variable from above
var greeting = `Aloha, ${name}`;


// Create a new variable named "isMinor", and use a comparison operator to
// assign a boolean value to this variable. If "age" is less than 18, the
// variable should be true, otherwise it should be false. You MUST use a
// comparison operator.
var isMinor == false;



//------------------------- Conditionals -------------------------//


// Express the following in code: If the variable age is greater than 100 log
// the statement 'Oh! So old!', otherwise, log the statement 'Still a spring
// chicken!'
function howOld () {
  if (age > 100) {
    console.log 'Oh! So old!'
  } else {
    console.log 'Still a spring chicken!'
  }
}


// Express the following in code: If the length of the variable name is longer
// the 5 characters, log the statement 'Hi there [name]!'. Otherwise, log the
// statement 'Well hello [name]'. In either case, the value stored in the name
// variable should be included in the logged statement.
function sayHello(name) {
  if (name.length > 5) {
    console.log(`Hi there ${name}`)
  } else {
    console.log(`Well hello ${name}`)
  }
}



//------------------------- Arrays -------------------------//

// Create a new variable "numbers" and assign it to an Array of 10 different
// numbers
var numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];


// Write the code to access the 5th element of the Array, using bracket
// notation.
numbers.[4];

// Create a new variable "planets" and assign it to an Array the 8 planets in
// our solar system, represented by their names as Strings.
var planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"];

// Write the code to access the 7th planet from the sun, using bracket notation.
planets.[6];
